                Reina exudes a charismatic sense of evil, reflecting her characterâ€™s duality in both personality and fighting style
                Reina's fighting style is a mixture of Taido and Mishima-style karate. She utilizes a special movement called Sentai to close the distance quickly and launch rushes, while Unsoku allows her to deliver powerful attacks with agile footwork, demonstrating a speedy and aggressive combat approach. In addition, Reina has somehow acquired techniques like Wind God Fist Thunder God Fist and Spinning Demon, synonymous with the Mishima-style karate, and even exhibits a power fighter aspect, delivering powerful fast moves.[
