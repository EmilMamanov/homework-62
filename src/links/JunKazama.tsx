            <p>Jun Kazama (風間 準 Kazama Jun?) is a character in the Tekken series who made her debut in Tekken 2. She is the mother of Jin Kazama, having raised him alone after failing to save Jin's father, Kazuya Mishima, from Devil's influence. Jin assumes her to be dead after witnessing her being attacked by Ogre on his fifteenth birthday, at a time when Ogre was attacking and killing participants of the second King of Iron Fist Tournament. Jun's official status, however, is "missing".[3] She has had multiple cameos and references in every mainline game following Tekken 2 despite not canonically returning as a playable character until Tekken 8. In the non-canonical Tekken Tag Tournament 2, after being defeated in Arcade Mode, Jun transforms into Unknown, the final boss.</p>
